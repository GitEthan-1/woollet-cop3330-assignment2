/**
 * Exercise 29 - Handling Bad Input
 * The rule of 72 is a quick method for estimating how long it will take to double your investment,
 * by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the expected rate of return.
 * It’s a good tool that helps you figure out if the stock, bond, or savings account is right for you.
 * It’s also a good program to write to test for and prevent bad input because computers can’t divide by zero.
 * And instead of exiting the program when the user enters invalid input, you can just keep prompting for inputs until you get one that’s valid.
 *
 * Write a quick calculator that prompts for the rate of return on an investment and calculates how many years it will take to double your investment.
 *
 * The formula is
 *
 * years = 72 / r
 * where r is the stated rate of return.
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * What is the rate of return? 0
 * Sorry. That's not a valid input.
 * What is the rate of return? ABC
 * Sorry. That's not a valid input.
 * What is the rate of return? 4
 * It will take 18 years to double your initial investment.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Don’t allow the user to enter 0.
 * Don’t allow non-numeric values.
 * Use a loop to trap bad input, so you can ensure that the user enters valid values.
 *
 * Challenge
 *
 * Display a different error message when the user enters 0.
